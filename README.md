## ðŸ”„ Exercice 2 ~ 10 minutes

In the file [`Exercice2.cs`](./exercise2/Exercice2.cs), write a .NET method `SumRange` that calculates the sum of integers between a minimum and maximum value (inclusive) using recursion.

The method should take two arguments: `min` and `max`. If `min` is greater than `max`, the method should return -1.

Examples:
- `SumRange(1, 5)` should return `15`, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
- `SumRange(5, 1)` should return `-1` since min is greater than max.
